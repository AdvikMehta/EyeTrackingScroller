# EyeTrackingScroller
A python implementation to scroll through your documents, webpages, etc using eye tracking.

Have you ever wanted to scroll through the book or lecture notes you were reading, but had food all over your hands and wanted it to scroll magically?
Well, I bring the magic to you. Just blink 5 times to activate the software, and glance at the top or bottom of the screen to scroll up or down!
That easy.
